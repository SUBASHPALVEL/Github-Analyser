# Github-Analyser
The GitHub Complexity Analyzer is a Python-based tool designed to analyze and evaluate the technical complexity of repositories within a GitHub user's profile. By leveraging the power of GPT and LangChain, this tool helps developers identify the most technically challenging repository associated with a given GitHub user's URL.

Upon receiving the GitHub user's URL, the tool utilizes the GitHub API to retrieve the user's repositories. It then proceeds to individually assess each repository using GPT, a state-of-the-art language model, and LangChain, a sophisticated complexity analysis tool.

The assessment process involves feeding relevant repository details, such as the repository name, description, and programming language, into the GPT model as a prompt. GPT generates a complexity score for each repository based on its understanding of the technical aspects and intricacies present within the codebase.

The LangChain component plays a vital role in enhancing the accuracy of complexity assessment. By employing advanced algorithms and techniques specific to code analysis, LangChain analyzes the repositories' structural and functional aspects, code complexity, project size, and other relevant factors.

The tool iterates through each repository, combining the results from GPT and LangChain, to determine the most technically complex and challenging repository. The repository with the highest complexity score is considered the most challenging.

With the GitHub Complexity Analyzer, developers can efficiently identify and prioritize repositories that require additional attention and expertise due to their technical complexity. This enables them to focus their efforts on addressing critical challenges and optimizing their development process.

Please note that the accuracy and effectiveness of the complexity assessment heavily depend on the quality and training of the GPT and LangChain models. Proper customization, training, and fine-tuning of these models to code-specific complexities are essential for obtaining reliable results.

The GitHub Complexity Analyzer empowers developers to make informed decisions, allocate resources effectively, and improve their overall development experience by identifying and tackling the most technically challenging repositories within a GitHub user's profile.
